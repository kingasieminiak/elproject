1. Description

The project is an example of Github Issues App. To see the effect,

2. 'Pixel perfect'

A) 
Due to the fact that the main purpose of the task was to fulfill the approach 'pixel perfect',
I decided to use pixels instead of relative units (ex. rem, em). In some cases I have decided 
to use percentages. I have found two different kind of fonts in PSD project, but I decided to add 
only Roboto Regular to index.html. Proxima Nova is not a free font. 

B) 
Sidebar has a different background than PSD effect — I came up with the assumption 
that the PSD project includes a 'graphical representation' of the actual effect. 
That's why i used 'opacity' instead of  'background image' and 'background blend mode'.

C)
Custom scroll bar is visible only in Google Chrome browser.


3. Sass 

I used Sass and Gulp in the project to show examplary components of the application. 
Each Sass component represent component which I would create in React App.


4. JavaScript 

I made two functions — first represent ES6 usage, second represent jQuery usage.
If you want to see the effect of ES6 function, please use Google Chrome browser.
