2. 'Pixel perfect'

A) 
Due to the fact that the main goal of the task was to fulfill the  ‘pixel perfect’ approach,
I decided to use pixels instead of relative units (ex. rem, em).
In some cases I have decided to use percentages.

B) 
I have found two different kind of fonts in PSD project but I decided to add only Roboto Regular to index.
Proxima Nova is not a free font.

C)
Sidebar has a different background than in PSD — I came up with the assumption that in PSD project 
is a ‘graphical representation’ of the actual effect. That’s why i used ‘opacity’ instead of  ‘background image’ 
and ‘background blend mode’.

D)
Custom scroll bar is visible only in Google Chrome browser.


3. Sass 

I used Sass and Gulp in the project to show example components of the application. 
Each Sass component represent component which I would create in React App.


4. JavaScript 

I made two functions — first represent ES6 usage, second represent jQuery usage.
If you want to see the effect of ES6 function, please use Google Chrome browser.
